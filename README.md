> My handwriting

This repository holds a key to my handwriting for the 26 letters of the alphabet both lowercase and uppercase, the 10 numbers, and 16 other special characters.

## Background

For security, it's sometimes necessary to record sets of characters without ever inputting them into a computer. Using handwriting to do this runs the risk of that handwriting being misinterpreted.

This repository serves to mitigate that risk by presenting my handwriting alongside equivalent characters in a known and recognized typeface.

To completely circumvent the issue, I recommend using a typewriter to carry out tasks of this nature when possible.
